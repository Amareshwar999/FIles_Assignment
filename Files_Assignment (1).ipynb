        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
        "  * Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime, translating each statement into machine code on the fly (e.g., Python).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Compiled languages translate the entire source code into machine code before execution, producing an executable file (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to catch and manage runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks, preventing program crashes and allowing graceful error recovery.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception ?\n",
        "  - The finally block ensures that specific code runs regardless of whether an exception occurred, often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python ?\n",
        "  - Logging in Python refers to recording messages about a programâ€™s execution, errors, or other events, typically using the built-in logging module.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing for resource cleanup.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python ?\n",
        "  - 'import' module imports the entire module.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 'from module import name' imports specific attributes or functions from a module.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python ?\n",
        "  - Multiple exceptions can be handled by specifying a tuple of exceptions in a single except block or by using multiple except blocks for different exception types.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "8.  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python ?\n",
        "  - The with statement ensures that files are properly opened and closed, even if exceptions occur, by managing the file context automatically.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing ?\n",
        "  - Multithreading: Multiple threads within a single process share memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently, each with its own memory space.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program ?\n",
        "  - Logging helps track events, debug issues, monitor application behavior, and maintain records for auditing and troubleshooting.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python ?\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python involves allocating and releasing memory automatically using a built-in garbage collector.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "  - Wrap code in a try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Catch exceptions with except.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Optionally use else for code that runs if no exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use finally for cleanup actions.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
        "  - Proper memory management prevents memory leaks, optimizes resource usage, and ensures efficient program execution.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
        "  - try contains code that may raise exceptions; except handles those exceptions if they occur.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        "  - Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to automatically reclaim unused memory.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        "  - The else block executes code if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "18.  What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python ?\n",
        "  - os.fork() works only on Unix; multiprocessing is cross-platform and higher level.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - Closing a file ensures that data is written to disk and resources are released.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "20.  What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python ?\n",
        "  - file.read() : reads the entire file or a specified number of bytes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - file.readline() : reads one line at a time.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
        "  - The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n",

        "  ---\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
        "  - Challenges include handling circular references, managing memory leaks, and optimizing memory usage in large applications.\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
        "  - Use the raise statement followed by an exception type, e.g., raise ValueError(\"Error message\").\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "25.  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications ?\n",
        "  - Multithreading is useful for I/O-bound tasks, improving responsiveness, and parallelizing operations that wait for external resources.\n",
